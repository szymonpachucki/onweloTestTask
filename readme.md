Fetch Book Info App
This web application is designed to provide information about books, including details about the author, title, and currency information as well as book cover. MY app allows you to input several books in one search you just need to input them in this format:
"author1", "title1","author2", "title2".

Handling Missing Data
It's important to note that the NBP (National Bank of Poland) API does not provide data for certain dates, especially for older books. In cases where currency data cannot be retrieved, the app displays 'no data' to inform users that the information is not available.

Frontend Considerations
The frontend of the application has been kept to a basic minimum, aligning with the primary focus on backend development for this project. If the scope were to include both frontend and backend development, additional technologies such as SCSS for CSS, BEM for naming conventions, and React for JavaScript and HTML could be incorporated to enhance the user interface and overall user experience.
