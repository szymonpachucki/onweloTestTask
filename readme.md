Hi, I created this app with a slightly different approach. In my version, you input data for one book at a time. I did this because I am not sure about the precise use case for this app; I assumed it would be a tool for customers wanting to learn more about individual books.

I noticed that the NBP API does not work well for older books, so I thought it might be confusing if users searched for a lot of books at once. If needed, it can be easily changed by modifying the form component and adding a function to format the inputted text into an array of objects with keys as author and title. Then, you can run the fetchBookInfo function for all of them.

As for the frontend, I kept it to a basic minimum since this position primarily focuses on backend development. If the task required both frontend and backend development, I would utilize SCSS and BEM for CSS, and React for JavaScript and HTML.
